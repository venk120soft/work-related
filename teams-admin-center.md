Teams is a communication platform Developing by Microsoft. It is one of the application offered in Office 365 suites, for any organization to manage teams application for their employees o365 offers Teams Admin Center.
where in the admins in organization are able to customize the teams application based on their needs. 
like if organization wants to buy third party applications (like WorkDay, Pickit, BreakThrugh) and customize it based on organization they can do it from the Teams Admin Center.

Admins have an access to TAc they will customize the applications, setup App policies, meeting, call, permission and many more policies based on the org requirment.
I'm primarily working on App Monetization feature where in we are providing the **App Monetization** for different app licenses every app available to purchase the license have already setup the pricings from the ISV(Independent Software Vendor).
In case if the organization needs discounts for their bulk purchases they have to directly contact the ISV's via the email.

Once the ISV 's are agreed to define the private plans to the organizations they will update the pricing for the specific tenants so within 48 hours those pricing details will be updated in TAC
Hence user should be able to purchase the app with reduced pricing for the licenses. these plans are called private plans

We also supported invoice purchases, In recent days it's pretty common way of purchasing through invoice option.

We have used the Purchase Blend experience.
