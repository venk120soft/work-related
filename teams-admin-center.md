My Name is Venkatesh Chunchu I'm an experienced software developer who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems.
Currently Working for Microsoft in Teams Admin Center Product. Also I have worked on Office 365 and Teams. I have extensive experience in working with Object Oriented Programming using .Net stack and Client side technologies using javascript libraries. 

Before this project I used to Work for Metlife which is one of the health care insurance provider. where in I was handling the team of 4 who is working from India and Srilanka

## About Project: 
In short: Teams Admin Center product is used by the Admins in an Organization which helps them to Monetize app licenses for employees, Customize and Configure the Teams Application create and setup the different policies can be permission polices, setup policies, meeting policies. Insights of an each app, Dial plans. and Technologies used: React JS, Web API and C#

I'm primarily working on App Monetization feature where in we are providing the App Monetization for different app licenses every app available to purchase the license have already setup the pricings from the ISV(Independent Software Vendor). In case if the organization needs discounts for their bulk purchases they have to directly contact the ISV's via the email.
#### Brief project description
Teams is a communication platform Developing by Microsoft. It is one of the application offered in Office 365 suites, for any organization to manage teams application for their employees o365 offers Teams Admin Center.
where in the admins in organization are able to customize the teams application based on their needs. 
like if organization wants to buy third party applications (like WorkDay, Pickit, BreakThrugh) and customize it based on organization they can do it from the Teams Admin Center.

Admins have an access to TAC they will customize the applications, setup App policies, meeting, call, permission and many more policies based on the org requirment.
I'm primarily working on App Monetization feature where in we are providing the **App Monetization** for different app licenses every app available to purchase the license have already setup the pricings from the ISV(Independent Software Vendor).
In case if the organization needs discounts for their bulk purchases they have to directly contact the ISV's via the email.

Once the ISV's are agreed to define the private plans to the organizations they will update the pricing for the specific tenants so within 48 hours those pricing details will be updated in TAC
Hence user should be able to purchase the app with reduced pricing for the licenses. these plans are called private plans

We also supported invoice purchases, In recent days it's pretty common way of purchasing through invoice option.

We have used the Purchase Blend experience. 
## MS FastTrack Widget Carousal component
This will help the use to learn more about how the user can FastTrack the process. We have Introduced new Carousal componet  which will be used over all the project.

Worked on First Run Experience for the user to help us the traffic and see the trends added Telemetry Overall the UI and Created the Charts with in the Aria, Jarvis, Lens explorer also exploring the Power BI for Building the funnel views to see the Up and down trends over the months of usage of feature.
## App Permission
Automate the process using using Protractor for Consenting the app permissions for each app we add into the App Summery table(In Manage apps page) 
to validat the user is able to consent the permissions for each app before we adding it in PROD hence this helps to do the followups with ISV's for their app to keep available within the Teams Admin Center.

Once the admin able to consent the app permissions and run through the ISV portal flow if everything works fine we enable that app in Production

## App Configuration
Admin User should be able to configure the diffrent parts of application such as app icon, name, color, etc to their employees to use the application with the name of their organization. and write the E2E for this

Created the facncy color picker component which can be used at overall Project. and Added the Error Boundry HOC component to validate each component has passed the right props to avoid javascript errors before going to PROD, which was used in Overall Project.

## Insights(Workday)
We provide the insights to the user about the application, where in they can install, pin into the Teams Admin Center and deploy the applications directly from the Teams Admin Center into Azure cloud. and write the E2E for this

## Setup Policies Group Policy Assignment
We had and option to Group policy assignment for serup policies using Powershell so Implemented the UI for Group Policy Assignment of Setup policies where in Admin can rank the policies based on the group, policy and can do the CRUD operations

## Daily Activities:
We have scrum planned for every 1 month, before planning the scrum we have retrospective meetings to address what are left from previous scrum, based on the decisions we move some of the items to next sprint.

As a Feature lead, I used to breakdown the feature work items into multiple tasks and sub tasks and assign accordingly to feature crew. 
Then every day we have sync to get the status and unblocking each other. For every work(Task/Bug) before working on it we used to create the work item under the specific feature work item and the Remaining time for the work to complete which helps in burndown the progress every day in sprint.

To finish any feature we look at the Definition of Done(DOD)
- Development completed
- Test completed
- E2E automation completed
- Telemetry logs, and charts are completed
- Security, Privacy, Compliance, Localization, Feature accesibility for the Disablity users is in place
- Feature flow diagram
